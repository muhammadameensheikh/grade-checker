# Grade Checker

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @muhammadameensheikh

I have created a grade checker using HTML, CSS and Javascript. The form validation is done using javascript which calculate the value of the grade entered between 0 to 100. A value less than 0 and greater than 100 and an empty field will show an error message. The error message is displayed under each form.

When the formVal() function is executed and there are no errors it will then execute the gradeCal() function, which will calculate and show the grade
